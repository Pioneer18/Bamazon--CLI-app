# Bamazon--CLI-app
`Bamazon` is an Amazon-like storefront app that will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. The User interacts with the app through the command line. 

When the application starts, it prompts the user for two things: 1) ID of the item the user would like to purchase. 2)The quantity of the item that the user would like to purchase. The user must manually enter the values and then press ENTER to view the results of their order.
